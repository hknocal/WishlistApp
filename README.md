# Welcome to the Wishlist App!

## Background
The wishlist application was made as part of a preliminary project up to a final semester exam and to work in depth with the skills learned. The project is built around CRUD operations and as such the final outcome is a small wishlist app where the user and admin can perform the following:

- The user can create a non-session based account where the email acts as the direct key to their wishlists
- The user can create wishlists, have visual overview of all wishlists and edit their titles and delete them
- The user can add items to the wishlists, which will be linked to the specific wishlist and the user can update the item attributes and delete them aswell.
- The admin has full access the user list and can edit and delete the user. From the user list the admin can access the wishlist and the linked items.

The application is working, but was developed primarily for small scale usage and therefore the admin layer is not yet protected.

## Tech stack
The project is built around the following tech stack:
- Java
- Spring Boot
- ThymeLeaf
- Bootstrap for CSS
- MySQL
